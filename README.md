# oneko-desktop

## THERE'S A NEW DESKTOP VERSION OF THIS AT https://github.com/eepyfemboi/oneko-golang WHICH SUPPORTS AUTO STARTING WITH WINDOWS AND IT DOESNT MAKE U GO INTO TASK MANAGER TO CLOSE IT!! :3 

cat follow mouse everywhere (real)

check https://github.com/eepyfemboi/oneko

website at https://sleepie.dev/oneko

also, when u try to run it, windows defender might get its panties all up in a bunch bcuz i dont wanna drop $400 to buy a code signing certificate, so if u dont feel safe running the prebuilt executable, feel free to download and build the source yourself ;3
